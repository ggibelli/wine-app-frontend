# Wine trading app client

This is the front-end of the wine trading app I developed for the Italian market, the app is still work in progress. I followed the design guidelines that were given to me from a designer that used Abode XD

## Technology used

This app is written using ReactJS and ApolloClient for the state management.

## Features

- Users can register (a mail is sent to verify email address)
- Users can post/update Ads
- Users can save Ad
- Users can open/close Negotiations
- Users can review other Users
- Users can send real time messages
- Users can manage their own ads and negotiations
- Admin can add or remove wines

## What is missing

At the moment some components are not fully graphically finished, the 404 page and error pages are missing, the notification texts are work in progress, the profile page is missing and various texts need to be updated.
The e2e tests are missing and so the CI/CD pipeline
